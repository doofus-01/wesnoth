    description= _ "Unlike the larger Giant Spider, that uses poison and webs to catch prey, the Shadow Jumper relies on speed and the element of surprise.  These stealthy, keen-eyed hunters creep to within striking distance, then pounce with a piercing bite that is said to punch through steel.  Certainly hide or bone will not protect the victim.

These giant jumping spiders often hunt in the same dark caverns as their web-weaving cousins, but they also prowl the forest canopy, ambushing happless wanderers on the ground below."
