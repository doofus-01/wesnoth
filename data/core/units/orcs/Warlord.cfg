    description= _ "While might is not the be-all end-all of supremacy in an orcish clan, it certainly is a prerequisite for earning the respect and obedience of other orcs. A warlord is most often the strongest fighter in his tribe, one who attains and holds his position by achieving victory time and time again over aspiring challengers. This might in combat permits such an orc to act as tribal chieftain, overseeing the day to day dealings of his clan as well as directing lesser warriors when the time comes for bloodshed. Though typically cunning and highly proficient at warfare, most warlords only earn admiration for their combative skills, lacking the knowledge or charisma to lead outside of battle. In time, this deficiency usually becomes the cause for a warlordâ€™s downfall when his skills wane with age and another powerful warrior arises to take his place."
