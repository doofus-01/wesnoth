    description= _ "Handling birds of prey for use in a military role is something that takes great skill and training on the part of the handler, if not the bird.  Dune Sky Hunters are the elite of the Falconers, and have moved beyong the smaller, more common falcon, and now work with a type of large eagle usually called a desert eagle, but often mistaken for a young Roc.  In the wild, the eagles often feed on larger prey such as wolves, small horses, and, it is said, naughty young children.

The primary reason for using the desert eagle instead of a falcon is it's greater effectiveness in combat.  While a falcon attack can be fended off with a sturdy shield, an eagle can knock over a typical enemy soldier, no matter how sturdy that shield."

    # Maybe the bird should have some "marksman" ability, since it actively corrects its flight.
    # But we also have to account for the defender not being able to hurt the bird.
    # So, we can say that the bird only strikes if it is safe, and a defender on favorable terrain can scare the bird off more often
