    description= _ "The power of any Dunefolk assault is inhibited by one major drawback: organized Dunefolk forces tend to be rather slow. Because of this, enemy forces often have the ability to regroup and call upon reinforcements, in which case a second assault becomes much more difficult.  Dune Falconers, an advanced corps pulled the skirmisher auxiliaries, have trained young falcons to fly directly back to them if the bird sees any humanoid or larger creature.  From the direction and flight time, the Falconer can estimate the direction and distance of any remote presence.  While this intelligence has limitations, it can be quite valuable in many contexts.  

The falcon also plays a role in combat, as the falconer can either direct it directly at a foe, or it can be sent higher into the air, to circle overhead and strike when the foe has shifted attention.  Needless to say, this can be very distracting to any opponent."
